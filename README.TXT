CARPUNK - THE CAR HACKING TOOLKIT
----------------------------------


WHAT'S NEW:

CARPUNK IS VERY SIMILAR TO CANghost, ONLY THE DEFFERENCE IS, IT COMES WITH OPTIONS TO ENABLE OR DISABLE INTERFACE AND BASIC SNIFFING AS EXTRA. 
+ IT WORKS ON BOTH SIMULATION & REAL CARS.
+ HAS THE OPTIONS TO RECORD AND PLAY THE CAN PACKETS.
+ NO ANY ARGUMENTS REQUIRED WHEN RUNNING BUT NEED CHANGES(Interface & Name for logfile), IF YOU'RE TRYING IN REAL-WORLD.
+ TESTED ON UBUNTU WITH BOTH SIMULATOR & REAL CARS.


-----------------------------------

THINGS TO DO BEFORE RUNNING CARPUNK:
+ YOU HAVE TO LOAD YOUR CANBUS DRIVER MANUALLY, CARPUNK ONLY DOES UP AND DOWN.
+ OPEN carpunk.sh FILE INTO YOUR FAVORITE TEXT-EDITOR AND CHANGE THE INTERFACE AND LOG-FILENAME AS PER YOUR NEED. DELAFULT INTERFCE IS vcan0 & carpunk AS LOG-FILENAME.




HAPPY HACKING!
